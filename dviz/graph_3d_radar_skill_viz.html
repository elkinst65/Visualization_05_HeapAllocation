    Graph 3D Radar Skill Viz
    Here we are using d3.js and d3plus.js libraries to create the graph for the 
    3d skill visualization.   Rather try to recreate the work from scratch, we
    are leveraging the work done by the d3plus.org/js/d3.js and 
    d3plus.org/js/d3plus.js libraries.   Our goal was to gain confidence in using 
    the libraries to create some nice outputs without doing much coding.

    Here you must understand how to use the d3.js && d3plus.js libraries to your
    advantage.  This is alot like obeject oriented programming, where you have to 
    know what you are trying to do before doing it.  Then check the libraries to 
    see if this functionality is already done.  There is no need to recreate the 
    wheel!!!!

    The graphics effects are great!   We measured the skills of a novice, junior, 
    and expert data scientist using the d3 radar function.

    radar.requirements = ["data", "size"];

    Based on the above, we must set the following variables
    - data
    - size
