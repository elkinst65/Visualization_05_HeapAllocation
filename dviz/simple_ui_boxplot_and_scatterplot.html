    Simple Box and Whisker 
    Here we are using d3.js and d3plus.js libraries to create the graph for the 
    3d skill visualization.   Rather try to recreate the work from scratch, we
    are leveraging the work done by the d3plus.org/js/d3.js and 
    d3plus.org/js/d3plus.js libraries.   Our goal was to gain confidence in using 
    the libraries to create some nice outputs without doing much coding.

    Here you must understand how to use the d3.js && d3plus.js libraries to your
    advantage.  This is a lot like object oriented programming, where you have to 
    know what you are trying to do before doing it.  Then check the libraries to 
    see if this functionality is already done.  There is no need to recreate the 
    wheel!!!!

    The graphics effects are great!   

    We created boxplots (box and whisker) plots for the year of 2016 and 2017.
    Here, we created a dummy dataset for 2016 and 2017.  

    Look at simple it is to create a ui interface 
    - just by setting the d3.ui attribute

    box: require("./types/box.coffee")
    box.requirements = ["data", "x", "y"] 

    scatter: require("./types/scatter.coffee")
    scatter.requirements = ["data", "x", "y"];

    Based on the above, we must set the following variables
    - data
    - x
    - y
